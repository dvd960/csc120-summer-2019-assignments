<h1>CSC 120: Programming Style</h1>

Programs are read much more often than they are written, so it is
important to pay attention to its <i>style</i>.  This document
lists (some of) the style requirements for programming assignments
in this class.  This list is <i><u>non-exhaustive</u></i>: 
you will be penalized if you violate these requirements; however,
you may also be penalized if your code uses poor style (in the latter
case, you will get a warning first, and penalized if the style
does not improve in subsequent assignments).
<p/>
For CSc 120, we will generally follow the style guidelines given in
<a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/" target="_blank">
  PEP 8 -- Style Guide for Python Code</a>.  In particular, you should
adhere to the rules given below.  
<p/>
<b>NOTE:</b> These rules will be expanded as the semester progresses and we
cover new topics.  When this happens, you will be informed of the change.
<p/>
<h2>Docstrings</h2>
The style guidelines below refer to 
<a href="http://www.pythonforbeginners.com/basics/python-docstrings" target="_blank">docstrings</a>.
A docstring for a function is a special kind of string that
begins with, and ends with, three double-quote (&quot;) characters,
and which provides documentation about the program entity it is attached to.
Examples of docstrings are available 
<a href="http://dolphm.com/pep257-good-python-docstrings-by-example/" target="_blank">here</a>.

<h2>I. What you write</h2>

<ol>
  <li>
    <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#code-lay-out" target="_blank">Layout</a>:
    <ul>
      <li>
	Indentation: 4 spaces per level.
      </li>
      <li>
	Line length: 79 characters.
      </li>
      <li>
	Use blank lines (sparingly) to indicate logical sections in your code.
      </li>
    </ul>	
    <p/>
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#comments" target="_blank">Comments</a>:
    Your code should be appropriately commented.
    <ul>
      <li>
        At the very beginning of each Python file you submit, you should place a docstring
	giving summary information about the program as a whole.  This summary should include
	the following information:
	<ol>
	  <li>
	    Name of file
         </li>
	  <li>
	    Name of author
         </li>
	  <li>
	    Purpose of the program
          </li>
         <li>
	   Course no., section no. semester
          </li>
        </ol>
	<p/>
	For example:
          <pre>"""
    File: pokemon.py
    Author: Charm Ander
    Purpose: Compute the maximum average values for various Pokemon attributes 
        and answer queries about them.
"""
        </pre>
      </li>
      <li>
	For functions and methods, state what they do, any preconditions the require,
	and any postconditions on the return value.
	<p/>
	For each function, this information  should be given in the form of a docstring (see above).
	The docstring should be placed immediately after the &quot;<b><tt>def</tt></b> <i>function_name(...):</i>&quot;
	line and should minimally include	the following information:
	<p/>
	<ol>
	  <li>
	    a brief (one or two line) summary of what the function does;
          </li>
	  <li>
	    what its arguments and return value (if any) are;
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    any assumptions made by the function, i.e., any pre-condition that
	    must be met in order for the function to work correctly; and
          </li>
	  <li>
	    what we can expect to be true after the function has finished
	    execution, i.e., its post-condition;
	  </li>
	</ol>
	<p/>
	For example:
	<blockquote>
           <pre>def sum_csv_string(csv_string):
    """Add the numbers in a string of comma-separated values.
  
    Parameters: csv_string is a string of comma-separated numeric values.
  
    Returns: A number that is the sum of the values in the argument string.
  
    Pre-condition: csv_string is a string.
  
    Post-condition: The return value is a number."""
          </pre>
	</blockquote>
        <p/>
	For your convenience, a template is available <a href="docstring-template.txt">here</a>.
	<p/>
      </li>
      <li>
	If the purpose or behavior of a piece of code is not obvious, comment it.
        However, don't just state the obvious&mdash;this only adds visual clutter.  
	For example, the following comment is clutter:
        <blockquote>
	  <b><tt>x = x + 1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;# increment x</tt></b>
	</blockquote>
	<p/>
	Examples of over-commenting are shown <a href="bad-style.html" target="_blank">here</a>.
	<p/>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#naming-conventions" target="_blank">
      Naming conventions:</a>
      <ul>
	<li>
	  <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#names-to-avoid" target="_blank">Names to avoid</a>
	</li>
	<li>
	  <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#class-names" target="_blank">Class names</a> should
	  use the <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#descriptive-naming-styles" target="_blank">
	    CapWords</a> convention (aka CamelCase or StudlyCaps).
	</li>
	<li>
	  <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#function-names" target="_blank">Function and method names</a>
	  should be lowercase, with underscores separating words as necessary.
	  <br/>
	  (We will add to these rules when we discuss objects and classes.)
	</li>
	<li>
	  Variable names should follow the same rules as function and method names.
	</li>
	<li>
	  <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#constants" target="_blank">Constants</a>
	  whould be written with all capital letters, with words separated by underscores.  E.g.:
	  <blockquote>
	    <b><tt>PI = 3.1416</tt></b><br/>
	    <b><tt>DEFAULT_SIZE = 64</tt></b>
	  </blockquote>
	</li>
      </ul>
      <p/>
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>List comprehensions:</b>
    <ul>
      <li>
	Don't use list comprehensions for code that has side effects.
      </li>
      <li>
	List comprehensions should not be nested.
      </li>
      <li>
	List comprehensions should not be &quot;too long&quot;.  For
	the purposes of this class, &quot;too long&quot; = 
	&quot;more than one line long&quot;.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p/>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2>II. How you write</h2>

<ol>
  <li>
    <b>Avoid redundancy.</b>
    If you see the very similar code sequences&mdash;i.e., code that either looks similar, or behaves
    similarly&mdash;appear in more than one place, consider pulling them into a function.
    <p/>
    <i>Exception:</i> Small fragments of trivial code, e.g., two or three statements to initialize or
    increment a few variables.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Avoid unnecessary complexity.</b>
    Everything else being the same, simple code and data structures are better than complicated ones.
    Therefore,
    If a data structure or algorithm discussed in class (lectures or discussion sections) does what
    you need to do, then&mdash;unless explicitly required by an assignment spec&mdash;you should
    not resort to something significantly more complex.
  </li>
</ol>
